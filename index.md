### Welcome

Embark on a journey to Scorpions Rest, a city of resplendence, an oasis cradled within the labyrinthine arms of a rugged desert canyon. As the sole beacon of civilisation for countless leagues in every direction, traversing to this sanctuary of sand and stone demands no small measure of courage and grit. Yet, those brave enough to conquer the arid expanse are rewarded with a bustling city teeming with prospects, where whispered secrets lurk beneath the sand-swept streets. One of you was guided here by a weathered parchment—an ancient map bearing little more than the city's name and an enticing limerick—who could resist its call? 

Upon entering the sunbaked embrace of Scorpions Rest, tales and myths curl around you like the desert wind. One story, in particular, resonates with the city's denizens, a tale of a city ten times larger than Scorpion's Rest. A city that flickers into existence under the torrid desert sun only to vanish the moment you dare to look away. Some dismiss it as a hallucination, a phantom born from the delirium induced by the desert's blistering heat. Yet others fervently believe in its reality, that this phantom city conceals impenetrable mysteries, forbidden knowledge, and unimaginable wealth—if one can but find the path that leads there. 

As you delve into the enigmas prevelant in the Sarab Valley, will you also unravel the truth of this spectral city? What trials await you in this arid land, a place as captivating in its stark beauty as it is deadly in its treacherous terrain? Will you master the desert's ruthless challenges and rise to its daunting call? Or shall you join the lamentable ranks of those claimed by the desert, lost forever within its shifting dunes? Only time, and the fickle winds of fate, will tell.

### Setting

The campaign takes place in the Sarab Valley, a region of vast desert partially enclosed by mountain ranges. 

By far the most developed city is Scorpions Rest which sits in a canyon created by the joining of the Lost Ranges and the Sandstone Ranges. This place is a hub for adventures, trade and scholars. It stands as the only significant population center for a thousand miles. 

Other smaller settlements dot the landscape but these are composed almost exclusively of Dessert Nomads.

A significant number of old ruins, lost places of worship and strange creatures also share the desert. Many holding interesting stories or treasure.

### What to expect

The story and world building are devised entirely by myself. The general DND mythos is mostly unchanged but the setting is specific and has variations. If you are looking to intertwine your character with the setting its probably best to ask me and I'll help out :)

This is my first time DMing other than the occasional one-shot. So, do bear with me as I get on top of it all!

We are using the DnD system with a few homebrew rules. Many of which will be familiar to you and others are too better reflect the environmental challenges your characters will face.

The campaign will include role play, combat (of course), mysteries and puzzles. So there will be something for everyone!

### Character Rules

#### Level
All characters will start at lvl 5. We will use a milestone based level up system.

#### Classes
I'm happy to be flexible with most things in this regard. Let me know if you want to do something different and I'll let you know if it works!

Definitely allowed:
- All Standard Classes
- LaserLlama
- Spherecasters
- Most things if you ask!

#### Races
Most races will be allowed. Again let me know if you want anything *unusual*.

#### Depth
There is always a pay off to having your character feel like it was part of the world from the start. So, I encourage you to come up with any interesting ways we could integrate your character into the world and lore. Don't forget to give your character good flaws too.

#### Starting Items and Resources
You can start with anything you could have reasonably aquired in your adventures through the world. Provided they are not magical.

* 500gp plus 1d10x25gp, normal starting equipment (Account for your background and remove/add gold as needed)
* [5e Tools](https://5e.tools/items.html#abacus_phb)

Further to that. Pick a magic item of class Rare or lesser from one of the sources below. I will approve them but thats only to ensure they don't conflict with the setting.

* [5e Tools](https://5e.tools/items.html#abacus_phb)
* [GriffonsSaddlebag](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGriffonsSaddlebag/) (Custom Magic Items, there are lots have a look)

#### What I want from you

##### Character Art
* Pintrest
* I have a Midjourney Subscription. I'm happy to work with you to generate your character art with it.

##### Background Story
* Who are you?
* Where are you from?
* Your Knives (see below)

##### Current Story
* What are your goals?
* What do you know about the setting?
* Have you been here long or just arrived?
* What have you been doing if you have been here awhile?
* How did you survive the daunting trek through the desert to get here?

##### Knives
Knives allow me to raise the stakes of a situation. Try to come up with at least 5 knives for your character. Picking from different categories is ideal.  

* Every named person your character cares about, living or dead +1 knife
* Every phobia or trauma your character experiences/has experienced +1 knife 
* Every mystery in your character's life (i.e. unknown parents, unexplained powers) +1 knife 
* Every enemy your character has +1 knife 
* Every ongoing obligation or loyalty your character has +1 knife 
* Additionally, every obligation your character has failed +1 knife 
* Every serious crime your character has committed (i.e. murder, arson) +1 knife 
* Every crime your character is falsely accused of +1 knife 
* Alternatively if your character is a serial killer or the leader of a thieves guild, those crimes can be bundled under a +1 BIG knife 
* Any discrimination experienced (i.e. fantasy racism) +1 knife
* Every favoured item/heirloom +1 knife 
* Every secret your character is keeping +1 knife
  
### Homebrew Rules
So, these are not yet entirely worked out, but I'd like to give an idea for what you might expect.

#### Environmental
The desert is deadly to the uninitiated. Maintaining hydration, temperature and keeping stocked on rations is of paramount importance. Additionally, its easy to stand out among the unbroken yellow of the dunes.

Likely, there will be a system of balanced punishment for failing to properly manage these things. Have a think about what your character might know regarding desert survival.

#### Combat
* *Flanking* - The same as we normally do it.
* *Loonytunes Falling* - If made to fall and its not your turn you start falling at the end of your next turn. If you have a means of flight you must pass a relevant check to start flying. Even if normally you would not need too.
* Others I've definitely missed.

#### General
* *Inspiration* - For particularly juicy role play and creativity with ideas.
