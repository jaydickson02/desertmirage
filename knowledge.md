Permanent seats are granted to members of noble houses, including the influential Khayin, Jude and Leviacus families. The remaining seats are filled at the discretion of the Elder. The Elder themselves serve for life and is chosen from the members of the governing body, by the people, after their passing.

To maintain order, the city employs a combined force of government-managed Protector Corps, led by Sheriff Zoya Leyna, and private security known as The Enforcers.

Scorpions Rest boasts a unique water supply originating from a massive lake atop the canyon. Aqueducts channel water throughout the city, sustaining lush plant life. The Leviacus Noble Family manages and controls the lake and aqueducts.

The city's prosperity extends to vast agricultural plots, primarily owned and operated by the Khayin noble family, ensuring a stable food supply.

The city's wealth is not limited to agriculture; it also extends to resource mining in the surrounding mountains, overseen by the Jude noble family.

Scorpions Rest has entered agreements with the Sandsailers, to deliver water and food to their outposts.

These outposts are primarily set at the three flat entrances to the Sarab Valley. The largest of which is Serephs Keep guarding the northern entrance.

The city is a hub for adventurers, explorers, and nomads, adding to its cultural diversity. Many seek to find their fortune in the desert which is full of unexplored ruins, caves and mysteries.
