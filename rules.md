# Homebrew Rules

### Resting

##### Short Rest
A Short Rest represents taking a moment to breath and recover from the rigours of battle and exploration. It takes half-an-hour to complete.

##### Nights Rest
A Nights Rest takes 8 hours to complete. It represents taking the night to recover from the rigours of the day. It functions similar to a short rest, however, you also gain one of the following benefits:
- Recover your proficiency bonus in spell slots/points. If you are level five, this could be one level three spell slot, or three level on spell slots, or any other combination that would equal three.
- Recover your proficiency bonus worth of hit dice.
- Recover a single use of a class feature that would normally require a long rest to recover.

##### Long Rest
A Long Rest takes twenty-four hours to complete, and requires a Sanctuary. Sanctuary's are permanent settlements or reinforced areas that provide strong and reliable safety to the party.

### Supply
Food and water are abstracted into a system called Supply. When you gain access to food and water you can add Supply to your inventory. 
- Small and medium creatures can get by with one supply per day. Large creatures need to consume two supply per day.
- Additionally one Supply will restore ten hit points to an injured creature.
- If a creature fails to consume the required Supply they gain 3 points of exhaustion.
- Consuming Supply in another form (polymorph, wildshape, etc.) is wasted and provides no nourishment when the creature returns to their normal form.

### Exhaustion
Exhaustion is different in this campaign. Every two levels of exhaustion adds a stacking -2 debuff to attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks and spell saves.

##### Effects of Exhaustion
On top of the stacking debuff additional effects occur at various levels of exhaustion.
- At sixth level all speeds are halved.
- At eight levels your AC is reduced by 5 Points.
- At ten levels all attacks made by you have disadvantage.
- At twelve levels of exhaustion you die.

##### Gaining Exhaustion
- Being in combat (Gained after combat concludes)
- Falling unconscious (1 Point each time)
- Being poisoned (1 Point each time)
- Strenuous activities (DM Discretion)
- Navigating Harsh Climates (Environment Dependant)
- Not consuming your required supply.

##### Removing Exhaustion
- A Short Rest (1 Point)
- A Nights Rest (2 Points)
- A long rest (All points)
- Potion of Refreshment (2 Points per potion) (Avoid effects of Extreme Heat)
- Consuming your required Supply (1 Point per required amount)
- Counteracting an effect (Ex. Bathing in cool water to relive heatstroke) (DM Discretion)

### Combat
* *Flanking* - The same as we normally do it.
* *Loonytunes Falling* - If made to fall and its not your turn you start falling at the end of your next turn. If you have a means of flight you must pass a relevant check to start flying. Even if normally you would not need too.
* *Death Saves* - Death saves will be rolled in secret. Either by DM or Player.

#### Will of the Hero
In a moment of great need those with fortitude can find it in themselves to move faster and think quicker than ever before.

Once a day you can manipulate the initiative order and take your turn next, you can choose to do this before or after legendary actions are taken. Taking this action forfeits your turn for that round. Further you immediately gain six points of exhaustion at the conclusion of your quickened turn.


### General
* *Inspiration* - For particularly juicy role play and creativity with ideas.
